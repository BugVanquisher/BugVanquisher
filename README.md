**Systems Architect | Safe GenAI & LLM Infrastructure | Scaling Mission‑Critical Systems**

---

## 🚀 About Me
- I build **ML/GenAI infrastructure** that reliably serves **billions of tokens per day**.
- Focused on **GenAI safety, scalable serving, orchestration, observability, quota & traffic management**.
- Strong believer in **idempotent design, high availability, and disciplined engineering communication**.
- I share my work through **open-source projects, blog posts, and interactive demos**.

## 🛠 Current Focus
- **GenAI Safety** — building production-grade safety supervision with tiered analysis, PII protection, and prompt injection defense.
- **LLM Infrastructure** — scaling inference with quota-tiered delivery, HA routing, and safety compute budgeting.
- **Agent Orchestration** — durable workflows and tool-call governance.
- **Observability** — metrics, logs, traces, dashboards for real-time monitoring of ML systems.
- **Open Source** — sharing practical implementations through Aether and related projects.
- **Writing** — technical blogs at [vincentli.dev/blog](https://www.vincentli.dev/blog).
