**Senior/Staff-level Engineer | Architecting LLM & ML Infrastructure | Scaling Mission-Critical Systems**

---

## 🚀 About Me
- I build **ML inference systems** that reliably serve **hundreds of millions of tokens per day**.  
- Passionate about **scalable serving, observability, quota & traffic management, and fairness evaluation**.  
- Strong believer in **idempotent design, high availability, and disciplined engineering communication**.  
- I share my work through **open-source projects, blog posts, and interactive demos**.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Status / Links |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [**Atlas**](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/Atlas) | Quota & traffic management gateway for LLM inference (Redis, FastAPI, Prometheus). Enables dynamic quotas, token-level governance, and observability. | 🚧 Active development |
| [**Hyperion**](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/Hyperion) | Scalable ML inference platform blueprint (Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana). Demonstrates HA patterns, autoscaling, observability. | ⭐ Pinned project |
| [**FairTune**](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/FairTune) | Fine-tuning + fairness evaluation pipeline with Streamlit dashboards. Helps evaluate trade-offs in generative AI models. | Open source |
| [**Awesome-LLM-Infra**](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/Awesome-LLM-Infra) | Curated guidebook covering the **LLM lifecycle** — pre-training, fine-tuning, inference, optimization, monitoring. Includes diagrams + references. | Growing collection |
| (Private) [**LLM-Router-Playground**](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/llm-router-playground) | Interactive demo that routes tasks across lightweight vs. heavyweight models based on complexity. Built with Streamlit + Docker for easy hosting. | Prototype demo WIP |

## 🛠 Current Focus
- **LLM serving reliability** — scaling inference infra with quota-tiered delivery & HA routing.  
- **Observability** — metrics, logs, traces, dashboards for real-time monitoring.  
- **Fairness evaluation** — benchmarking trade-offs in fine-tuned models.  
- **Personal branding** — writing technical blogs ([vincentli.dev/blog](https://www.vincentli.dev/blog)) and showcasing open-source demos.
