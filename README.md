# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m BugVanquisher

**Senior/Staff-level ML/LLM Infra Engineer** â€” crafting robust, high-throughput LLM infrastructure at the intersection of ML and infra.

I work on ML inference systems that serve **X00+ million** tokens per day.

---

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- **Atlas**: Traffic Governance & Resource Allocator for LLM inference pipelines.
- **Hyperion**: A scalable ML inference platform focusing on reliability, caching, monitoring, and production-ready deployment. Inspired by my own [mini-llm-platform](https://github.com/BugVanquisher/mini-llm-platform) repo.
- Developing observability tooling for LLM-serving systems, focused on latency, token cost, and fairness metrics.
