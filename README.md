**Senior/Staff-level Engineer | Architecting Safe GenAI & LLM Infrastructure | Scaling Mission-Critical Systems**

---

## 🚀 About Me
- I build **ML inference systems** that reliably serve **billions of tokens per day**.
- Passionate about **GenAI safety, scalable serving, observability, quota & traffic management**.
- Strong believer in **idempotent design, high availability, and disciplined engineering communication**.
- I share my work through **open-source projects, blog posts, and interactive demos**.
